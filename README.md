[A very early prototype of my world simulation stuff from before university. From what I remember this gets about as far as generating a map and star data, but doesn't have much else to it.]

Stellar World Generator intends to create a science-fantasy world simulation, starting from creation and lasting for several hundred years. 

It details the histories of civilizations, settlements, and characters and how they interact in a simulated environment.
